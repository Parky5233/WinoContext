# WinoContext

WinoContext dataset consists of the following files:
data/0_context_masked.json, data/1_context_masked.json, data/2_context_masked.json, data/3_context_masked.json

prep_data.py can be run to generate our prompts. Alternatively if you want you can simply load the prompts already in the data folder and run prompting.py to prompt GPT-3

Performance metrics each have their own respective py file which can be run to get metrics on the responses (stored in the responses folder)
